## Introduction

I have chosen to replicate Study 2 in the paper "Effects of donation collection methods on donation amount: Nudging donation for the cause and overhead" because it aligns closely with my research interests in charitable giving and prosocial behavior, particularly in addressing the challenge of overhead aversion. Overhead aversion refers to the tendency of donors to be reluctant to contribute to a charity's operational costs, often preferring their donations to go directly to the cause. This aversion can negatively impact charities by limiting their ability to cover essential costs such as staffing and infrastructure, which are critical to achieving long-term goals. The paper I’ve chosen examines how different donation collection methods, such as varying the sequence in which donors are asked to contribute to the cause and overhead, can mitigate overhead aversion and increase the total donation amount without reducing donor satisfaction. The paper's findings are intriguing and I'm curious to see whether the results can be replicated. Its findings have strong implications for helping nonprofit organizations overcome overhead aversion and increase contributions sustainably, which aligns with my research focus on effective charitable giving strategies.

To replicate the experiment, the main stimuli will include a charitable donation scenario, where participants are asked to make donation decisions using different collection methods. Participants will be asked to imagine they have a specific amount of money (e.g., \$20 or \$6, depending on the study) to donate, and then go through different donation processes. The key manipulation involves varying how the donation options are presented: participants will first decide how much to give to the cause, followed by how much to contribute to overhead (cause first), or vice versa (overhead first).

One challenge will be designing the donation collection screens in a way that mimics real-world charity websites, making the stimuli both realistic and easy for participants to understand. Another potential difficulty is ensuring that participants take the scenario seriously, especially in an online setting where hypothetical donations might not fully capture real-world behaviors. Additionally, recruiting a sufficient and diverse sample of participants with varying levels of donation experience could be challenging, as previous donation experience has been shown to influence outcomes.

## Methods

### Power Analysis

Original effect size, power analysis for samples to achieve 80%, 90%, 95% power to detect that effect size. Considerations of feasibility for selecting planned sample size.

### Planned Sample

Planned sample size and/or termination rule, sampling frame, known demographics if any, preselection rules if any.

### Materials

All materials - can quote directly from original article - just put the text in quotations and note that this was followed precisely. Or, quote directly and just point out exceptions to what was described in the original article.

### Procedure

Can quote directly from original article - just put the text in quotations and note that this was followed precisely. Or, quote directly and just point out exceptions to what was described in the original article.

### Analysis Plan

Can also quote directly, though it is less often spelled out effectively for an analysis strategy section. The key is to report an analysis strategy that is as close to the original - data cleaning rules, data exclusion rules, covariates, etc. - as possible.

**Clarify key analysis of interest here** You can also pre-specify additional analyses you plan to do.

### Differences from Original Study

Explicitly describe known differences in sample, setting, procedure, and analysis plan from original study. The goal, of course, is to minimize those differences, but differences will inevitably occur. Also, note whether such differences are anticipated to make a difference based on claims in the original article or subsequent published research on the conditions for obtaining the effect.

### Methods Addendum (Post Data Collection)

You can comment this section out prior to final report with data collection.

#### Actual Sample

Sample size, demographics, data exclusions based on rules spelled out in analysis plan

#### Differences from pre-data collection methods plan

Any differences from what was described as the original plan, or “none”.

## Results

### Data preparation

Data preparation following the analysis plan.

```{r include=F}
### Data Preparation

#### Load Relevant Libraries and Functions

#### Import data

#### Data exclusion / filtering

#### Prepare data for analysis - create columns etc.
```

### Confirmatory analysis

The analyses as specified in the analysis plan.

*Side-by-side graph with original graph is ideal here*

### Exploratory analyses

Any follow-up analyses desired (not required).

## Discussion

### Summary of Replication Attempt

Open the discussion section with a paragraph summarizing the primary result from the confirmatory analysis and the assessment of whether it replicated, partially replicated, or failed to replicate the original result.

### Commentary

Add open-ended commentary (if any) reflecting (a) insights from follow-up exploratory analysis, (b) assessment of the meaning of the replication (or not) - e.g., for a failure to replicate, are the differences between original and present study ones that definitely, plausibly, or are unlikely to have been moderators of the result, and (c) discussion of any objections or challenges raised by the current and original authors about the replication attempt. None of these need to be long.
